How to organize multiple views on the screen?

		- Give views a 0dp height or width and a fraction of the weightSum of the layout in the layout_weight attribute
- Relative Layout

Q&A:
1. A ViewGroup (such as a LinearLayout for instance) allows you to organize the components of the graphical user interface.

 A component may be a ViewGroup it-self, containing other elements.
 
2. For each View or ViewGroup you need to specify the layout_width and layout_height. You can use fixed sizes (in pixels for instance) 
but which constant can you use to specify that the view should be just large enough for its content (and eventual padding)?

wrap content

3. For each View or ViewGroup you need to specify the layout_width and layout_height. You can use fixed sizes 
(in pixels for instance) but which constant can you use to specify that the view should be as large as the view into which it is included?

match_parent
